# MyMGS
An MGS School Council project.

## About this project
We're making an app to help MGS students navigate school life. This app will eventually include a range of features:

- A list of clubs, talks, societies, and drama performances
- Up-to-date catering menu â€” and a quick way to see what today's menu is
- Links to well-being charities
- Practical revision resources, sorted by year group and subject
- ...and more!

## Getting started
To get started developing MyMGS, [take a look at Pal's slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PeUDCDDno2yWrFLfk6lrHQWurxSg167CJwW3c2knNwk/edit?usp=sharing) which contains some handy tips on how to install the Flutter SDK and set up your environment.
