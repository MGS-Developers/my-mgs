// never hard-code this anywhere in the app — always refer to this variable
// as a compile-time constant ('const'), the end result will be the same as hard-coding.
// remember that this only applies to Dart-based app name references — the app/play store listings and OS app registration requires platform-specific code so are independent of this variable
