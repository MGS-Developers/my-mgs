# hey there! this is pal speaking
# the .gitignore file has a really simple but important purpose
# it's a list of files, directories (that's a fancy word for folders), and file types to never publish to Git or GitHub
# for example, we don't want to publish build files to GitHub, because these will be different depending on what OS the developer is using
# anything listed in here will be ignored by git and never addded
